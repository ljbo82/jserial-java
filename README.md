# Java Serial Communication Library

This repository contains a java library providing serial communication capabilities.

## Supported platforms

Library uses JNI in order to provide serial communications. Because of these native calls, library is supported currently for the following platforms (all of them must have a JRE8+):

* linux-x64
* windows-x64

## Compiling

In order to compile this library, the following tools must be present on the system (the validated build machine was running Ubuntu 20.04):

* [JDK8+](https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=8)

  * On ubuntu, JDK8+ can be installed via apt:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install openjdk-<version>-jdk
    ```

* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (v3.6+)

  * On ubuntu, maven can be installed via apt:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install maven
    ```

* [jserial-jni library](https://github.com/ljbo82/jserial-jni)

  * Platform native libraries (_jserial-jni-x64.so_ and _jserial-jni-x64.dll_) are expected to be present in the directory **src/main/resources/native**.

  * For details on how to build these libraries, check [jserial-jni](https://github.com/ljbo82/jserial-jni) project.

Will all dependencies satfisfied, just call `mvn` from project root directory:

```sh
mvn package
```

Generated JAR will be located into **target/jserial-x.y.z.jar**.

Or, in order to install into [local repository](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-local-repository):

```sh
mvn install
```

## Cleaning source tree

In order to delete the artifacts generated by build process, just call (from the project root directory):

```sh
mvn clean
```
